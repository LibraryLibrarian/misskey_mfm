## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-21

### Added
- I rewrote the parsing process from scratch using Dart and petitparser, based on mfm-js.  
At this stage, the basic parsing functionality is complete.  
I plan to create the rendering process using a different library in the future.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-21

The reason for the PUB POINTS being 150 on pub.dev was due to exceeding the 180-character limit in the description.  
I shortened part of the explanation to fit within the base character count. There are no changes to the library's functionality with this update.
